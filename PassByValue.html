            console.log(x); => last one to be executed 
            but x is 1, that means even though x had updated but that's applus 
            only inside of function, I think this is what people call pass by value

                // but JS reads that codes as a new property and value so It doesn't work like this 
                // pass by reference ? so I guess this(declaring property and value) is called as pass by reference 
                // because the declaration has added new property and value ( item = {value: 2})
